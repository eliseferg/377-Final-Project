# 377-Final-Project
Commons | Social Media for the Workplace

Commons is a social media platform that allows coworkers within the same company to remain connected with each other virtually. Through having an account on Commons they are able to interact with the platform and specify their hobbies and interests outside of the office in order to connect with peers with the same interests.

The application is mainly supported on desktop browsers, specifically google chrome or microsoft edge. However, the application 
can maintain its functionality on ios.

Developers manial can be found at the bottom half of this file.

The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.

They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.

You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.

# Developers Manual
- How to install your application and all dependencies
- How to run your application on a server
- How to run any tests you have written for your software
- The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PATCH, etc endpoints, and what they each do
- A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.

Documentation needs to be written in Markdown (MD) files, nicely formatted
Documentation should be included in each teamâ€™s final code submission.
Documentation should be saved in your main project directory under "docs"
